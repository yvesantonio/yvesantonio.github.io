My name is Yves Antonio Brandes Costa Barbosa and I am a detail- and goal-oriented engineer committed to delivering high-quality software and services. I spent the last four years of my career working with software development and simulation tools in top research institutes, universities, and industry partners in Brazil, Italy, the US, and Japan. In those years, I also had the opportunity to share my work in 13 international conferences, workshops, and academic seminars. My goal has always been to look for opportunities to improve performance, reliability, and automation, maintaining and optimizing relevant systems, while producing detailed technical documentation. For this reason, I strongly believe that I have acquired the independence, flexibility, time management and organizational skills that are required to excel in my work.
